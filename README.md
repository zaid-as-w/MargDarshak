🧠 An AI Career Path Recommender System

A simple, beginner-friendly AI-powered career recommendation web application that suggests suitable career paths for students based on their interests, skills, and favorite subjects.

This project uses a Node.js backend, a lightweight HTML/CSS/JS frontend, and supports two modes:

✅ 1. AI Mode (Gemini API)

If the user provides a free HuggingFace API key, the system generates natural, personalized responses using a text-generation model.

✅ 2. Offline Mode (Rule-Based AI)

If no API key is provided, the system automatically switches to a local rule-based recommendation engine, making the project fully functional even offline — ideal for college demonstrations.
